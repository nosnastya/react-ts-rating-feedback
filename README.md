Then, in your browser, open http://localhost:3000/ to view it! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

This is a sample project created with:
- React
- Typescript
- Redux
- redux-persist
- Chart JS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Fow css I used node-sass package in order to create scss modules to encapsulate styles for a specific component. I also used global css classes with atomic approach for more generic styles.

I used react persist to save your search queue and results, so if you reload the page you won't lose the state.
